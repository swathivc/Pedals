# Pedals

**Problem:**

Students in the college face transportation issues, for example, when you have an extra class suddenly scheduled in the afternoon and you have to walk from your hostel to the lecture hall in the scorching sun. Is there any effective solution to this?

**Solution:**
 
An 'effective' cycle rental service. But where do the cycles come from?

Final years can donate the cycles they used once they end their college days.

There are many unused cycles which are kept as junk by the authority, cycles which no longer have any owners

But is this enough to serve the needs of so many students? Maybe not. We have another addition to this list:

Allowing students who already own bicycles to rent them out to others on campus can be a brilliant addition to our cycle rental service. This approach not only expands the availability of bicycles but also provides an opportunity for students to earn extra income.

**What are we going to make**

A web app.

- Users need to login using college email id, to restrict the service within the campus.

- Users can choose from cycles available at a particular time according to their needs (the location they are in, geared/non-geared, etc.)

- Students can list their own cycles for rentals.

- Payment gateway within the website to facilitate faster and secure payments.

- An effective cycle return mechanism through OTP.

- Cost of rent will depend upon time of rental.

Tech stack:

1. React.js for frontend
2. Node.js and Express.js for backend
3. Tailwind CSS for the UI
4. Cloudinary for managing images
5. MongoDB as database
6. Mongoose as the data modeller for the application
